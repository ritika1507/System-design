🗝️ SSH Basics – Notes


--------What is SSH?--------
SSH (Secure Shell) → protocol to securely connect to remote systems.
Uses encryption to protect commands, passwords, and files.


--------How SSH Works--------
1. Client requests connection → ssh user@server
2. Server identity checked (~/.ssh/known_hosts)
3. Authentication
        Password
        Public/Private key pair (preferred)
4. Encrypted session established


--------Key-Based Authentication--------
Private key → stays on local machine (~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
Public key → copied to server (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
Client proves ownership of private key → server grants access


--------Important Files (~/.ssh/)--------
id_ed25519 → private key (keep secret, chmod 600)
id_ed25519.pub → public key (share with servers)
authorized_keys → server file with allowed public keys
known_hosts → remembers trusted servers
config → shortcuts / key mappings

Example config:
Host myserver
  HostName server.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519



--------ssh-agent--------
Stores private keys in memory → no need to type passphrase each time
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


--------Common Uses--------
1.      Remote login:
          ssh user@server
2.      File transfer:
          scp file.txt user@server:/path/
          sftp user@server
3.      Port forwarding (tunnel):
          ssh -L 5432:localhost:5432 user@server
4.      Jump host:
          ssh -J jumpserver targetserver


--------Gotchas--------
1. Permissions:
        ~/.ssh → 700
        Private keys → 600
2. First-time connection asks to trust server fingerprint
3. Multiple keys → use ~/.ssh/config


👉 SSH = Secure, Key-based, Configurable, Extensible
