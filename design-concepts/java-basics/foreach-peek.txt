Difference between forEach() and peek()

forEach() â†’ terminal operation (consumes stream).
peek() â†’ intermediate operation (used mainly for debugging).

Stream.of("A", "B", "C")
      .peek(s -> System.out.println("Peek: " + s)) // still part of pipeline
      .forEach(System.out::println);               // executes


ðŸ‘‰ peek() doesnâ€™t run unless a terminal op is called.
