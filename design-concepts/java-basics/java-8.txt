1. What are the key features introduced in Java 8?

Lambda Expressions â†’ Enables functional programming (e.g., (a, b) -> a + b).
Functional Interfaces â†’ Interfaces with exactly one abstract method (e.g., Runnable, Comparator,
plus new ones in java.util.function).
Stream API â†’ Work with collections in a functional way (map, filter, reduce).
Optional Class â†’ Handle nulls more gracefully.
Default & Static Methods in Interfaces â†’ Interfaces can have concrete method implementations.
New Date & Time API (java.time) â†’ Immutable and thread-safe (LocalDate, LocalTime, ZonedDateTime).
Collectors API â†’ For aggregations like grouping, partitioning, joining.
New concurrency improvements â†’ e.g., CompletableFuture.

ðŸ‘‰ Interview Tip: When asked, mention Lambda, Streams, Optional, Date/Time API, Default Methods first.
