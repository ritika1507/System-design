Jump Host (Proxy / Bastion)

👉 Definition: Sometimes you can’t directly SSH into your target server because of firewalls or network rules.
You must “hop” through a middle server (jump host / bastion).

Manual way:
ssh -J user@jumpserver user@targetserver

Connects to jumpserver first, then automatically forwards to targetserver.
With config (~/.ssh/config):
Host target
  HostName targetserver
  User ubuntu
  ProxyJump jumpserver

Then just run:
ssh target


✅ Use case: Your company might only expose one bastion/jump box to the internet. From there, you hop into private servers
inside the network.

⚡ Quick analogy:
Jump host = going through a checkpoint gate before reaching the actual server.
