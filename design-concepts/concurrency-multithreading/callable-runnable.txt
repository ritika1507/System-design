Difference between Callable and Runnable

Runnable
    i.  Returns no result, cannot throw checked exceptions.
    ii. Used for fire-and-forget tasks.

Callable
    i.   Returns a result (Future<V>).
    ii.  Can throw checked exceptions.
    iii. Typically used with ExecutorService.submit().

ðŸ‘‰ Quick one-liner: Runnable is for tasks without return, Callable is for tasks with a return value and exception handling.
