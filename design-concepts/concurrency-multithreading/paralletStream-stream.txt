Difference between parallelStream() and stream()

stream(): Sequential execution of pipeline operations.
parallelStream(): Splits tasks into multiple threads (uses ForkJoinPool.commonPool).
Parallel streams can speed up CPU-bound operations but may cause overhead for small tasks.

ðŸ‘‰ Interview tip: Always mention: "Parallel streams should be used carefully â€” not suitable when tasks are I/O heavy or when order matters."
