How does the CompletableFuture API work?

    Part of Java 8â€™s java.util.concurrent.
    Used for asynchronous programming.
    Lets you run tasks in background (supplyAsync, runAsync).
    Supports chaining (thenApply, thenAccept, thenRun).
    Can combine multiple futures (thenCombine, allOf, anyOf).
    Exception handling built-in (exceptionally, handle).

ðŸ‘‰ Interview tip: "CompletableFuture helps avoid callback hell and makes async code more readable.
Iâ€™ve used it to parallelize API/database calls and then combine results efficiently."
