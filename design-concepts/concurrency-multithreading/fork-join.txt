Fork/Join Framework and its advantages

    Introduced in Java 7 (java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool).
    Uses work-stealing algorithm.
    Designed for problems that can be recursively split into subtasks (divide & conquer).
    Example: parallel merge sort, recursive computations.
    Each worker thread can "steal" tasks from others to balance load.

ðŸ‘‰ Advantages:
    Efficient CPU utilization for parallelizable tasks.
    Better than normal thread pools for recursive decomposition tasks.
