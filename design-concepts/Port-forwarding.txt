Port Forwarding (Tunneling)

ðŸ‘‰ Definition: It lets you securely access a service running on a remote machine (like a database or web app) as if it were local.

Local port forwarding: Forward a local port to a remote service.
    ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@server
Connects your localhost:8080 â†’ goes securely through SSH â†’ remote serverâ€™s port 80.
Example: You can access a private web server on the remote machine by opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Remote port forwarding: The opposite â†’ expose your local service to the remote machine.
    ssh -R 9000:localhost:3000 user@server
Makes your local service at port 3000 available on the remote:9000.

âœ… Use case: Access a database on a server that isnâ€™t exposed to the internet (safe dev access).

âš¡ Quick analogy:
Port forwarding = creating a secret tunnel to access a service thatâ€™s otherwise blocked.
